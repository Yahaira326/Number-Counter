# Number-Counter

A counter featuring three buttons, a title, and a control number. We'll use Bootstrap to design the buttons. Clicking the plus button increases the number and changes its color to green. Clicking the minus button decreases it. If the number is less than zero, its color changes to red. Lastly, the reset button sets the number back to zero.
